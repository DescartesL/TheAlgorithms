### Some information about the repository.
All algorithms are implemented on Python. For the execution of algorithms, the standard Python library version 3.6 is required. These algorithms are need for practice Python, a better understanding of algorithms and education the programming.
- Algorithm.
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

- Computer algorithm.
In computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.
